### Work Estimation Method

Our team uses Planning Poker for estimating the effort required for tasks.

**Planning Poker Details:**
- Card values: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ?
- Meaning of values:
  - 1 = Very simple task (less than 1 hour)
  - 2 = Simple task (1-2 hours)
  - 3 = Moderate task (half a day)
  - 5 = Significant task (about one day)
  - 8 = Complex task (1-2 days)
  - 13 = Very complex task (2-3 days)
  - 21 = Extremely complex task (more than 3 days)
  - ? = Cannot estimate, needs further discussion or breakdown
- Process: During our sprint planning meetings, the Product Owner presents each user story to the team. After a brief discussion to understand requirements, each team member privately selects a card representing their effort estimate. All cards are revealed simultaneously, and if significant discrepancies exist, team members with the highest and lowest estimates explain their reasoning. We then discuss and re-estimate until reaching consensus, recording the final estimate in the corresponding GitHub issue.
