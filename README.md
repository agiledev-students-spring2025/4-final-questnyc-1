# Quest NYC: The Ultimate Urban Exploration Game  

## What and Why  

Quest NYC is a location-based game that turns New York into a real-world RPG. Players walk around the city completing quests, solving quizzes, and collecting virtual rewards by visiting key locations.  

The goal is to encourage walking, exploration, and engagement with the city's rich history, culture, and its hidden gems while making it fun and interactive. This app benefits tourists, new residents, and even longtime locals by helping them explore the city like they never have before.

## How  

From a user's perspective:  

1. **Choose Quests** – Pick from themed adventures like “Historic NYC,” “Hidden Art,” “Foodie Hunt,” or “Ghost Stories.”  
2. **Navigate to Checkpoints** – Players must physically walk to designated real-world locations to unlock story points, trivia, or puzzles.  
3. **Solve Challenges** – Answer trivia, complete mini-games, or interact with location-based content.  
4. **Earn Rewards & Level Up** – Players gain XP, collectibles, and unlock new quests.  
5. **Compete or Collaborate** – Engage in challenges with friends or join leaderboard rankings.  

### Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** React (Next.js for SSR and performance optimization)  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing quests, user progress, and leaderboards  
- **APIs:** Google Maps API for location services

## Scope  

We are planning to include:  
- A database of manually curated quests 
- User authentication and profile tracking  
- A leaderboard system for friendly competition 
- Interactive maps with real-time quest progress

Future versions could expand to include user-generated quests and social features.

## ML Integration

We would like to use ML to do:

1. **Personalized Quests**: Use collaborative filtering to suggest quests based on past preferences and locations the player may frequent.
2. **Dynamic Quest Generation**: Natural language processing can analyze recent news and events to create relevant new location-based quests dynamically.
3. **Difficulty Adjustment**: The player's skill level can be predicted through reinforcement learning to adjust quest difficulty accordingly.
